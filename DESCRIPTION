Description: Supplement for the book "Handbook of Regression Methods" by D. S. Young.  Some datasets used in the book are included and documented.  Wrapper functions are included that simplify the examples in the textbook, such as code for constructing a regressogram and expanding ANOVA tables to reflect the total sum of squares.
